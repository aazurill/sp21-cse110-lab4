# Part 3
1. The bug was that JS was interpreting the input of the first number and second number as strings. Thus, when they were "added" together, string concatenation was used instead of number adding.
2. I would fix this issue by casting the input num1 and num2 into integers in order to make sure they are interpreted as numbers before getting added together in calculateSum.
